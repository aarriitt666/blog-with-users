If your website hosted on Heroku stopped working after you switched to postgres using the instructions in this section,
try the following:

After getting the DATABASE_URL config variable, create another one named DATABASE_URL1 (or any other name you want),
copy/paste the value of the DATABASE_URL variable, but change 'posgres://' to 'postgresql://'

And in you main.py instead of DATABASE_URL, use DATABASE_URL1

Hope this saves someone an hour or two, which I had to spend looking for a solution :)
